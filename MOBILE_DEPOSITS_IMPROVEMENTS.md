# Mobile Deposits View Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the mobile deposits view, including fixing amount formatting and adding reason functionality for approve/reject actions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Amount Formatting Fix
Fixed the currency formatting to properly display thousand separators (dots) for Indonesian Rupiah (IDR):

#### Before
- Amounts were displayed without proper thousand separators
- Example: "Rp 1000000"

#### After
- Amounts now display with proper thousand separators
- Example: "Rp 1.000.000"

#### Implementation Details
- Enhanced `formatCurrency` function to handle various input formats
- Added cleaning logic to remove existing formatting before parsing
- Used `Intl.NumberFormat` with 'id-ID' locale for proper formatting
- Added error handling for invalid number inputs

### 2. Reason Functionality for Approve/Reject
Added reason functionality for approver/reject actions:

#### Features Added
- Modal dialog for entering reason when approving/rejecting deposits
- Textarea input for detailed reason
- Validation to ensure reason is provided
- Pass reason to backend API (stubbed for now)

#### Implementation Details
- Added `useState` hooks for managing dialog state
- Created `handleApproveWithReason` and `handleRejectWithReason` functions
- Implemented `handleConfirmAction` to process the action with reason
- Added Dialog components from UI library
- Updated component props interface to include reason parameter

#### UI Components
- Approve button now opens reason dialog
- Reject button now opens reason dialog
- Dialog includes:
  - Title based on action type
  - Description prompting for reason
  - Textarea for reason input
  - Cancel and Confirm buttons
  - Validation to prevent empty reasons

### 3. Files Modified
1. `/frontend/src/features/deposits-management/components/mobile-deposits-list.tsx`
   - Added Dialog components import
   - Added state management for reason dialog
   - Enhanced formatCurrency function
   - Added reason dialog UI
   - Updated approve/reject button handlers

2. `/frontend/src/features/deposits-management/deposits-management-page.tsx`
   - Updated approve/reject function signatures to accept reason parameter
   - Added console logging for reason (stub for actual API implementation)

## Technical Details

### FormatCurrency Function
The enhanced formatCurrency function now:
1. Cleans input by removing non-numeric characters
2. Parses the clean string to a float
3. Validates the parsed number
4. Formats using Indonesian locale with proper currency symbols and separators

### Reason Dialog Flow
1. User clicks Approve/Reject button
2. Dialog opens with reason input
3. User enters reason and clicks Confirm
4. Reason is passed to the appropriate handler function
5. Action is processed with the provided reason

## Testing
The changes have been implemented with proper error handling and validation:
- Invalid number inputs default to Rp 0
- Empty reasons prevent dialog confirmation
- Console logging shows reason values for debugging
- UI adapts to different screen sizes

## Future Improvements
- Connect reason functionality to backend API
- Add reason display in deposit details
- Implement reason history tracking
- Add character limits for reason input
