# BLE Sales Transaction Feature Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing and using the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Sales Transaction feature. This feature enables seamless communication between the sales application and ESP32-based sales devices, allowing operators to process fuel sales transactions directly from physical devices with automatic data synchronization.

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Frontend Application**: React-based mobile sales interface with BLE capabilities
2. **ESP32 Device**: Physical sales terminal with Bluetooth connectivity
3. **Backend API**: RESTful services for sales data processing
4. **Database**: Storage for sales transactions and related data

### Data Flow
1. Operator interacts with frontend interface
2. Transaction data is synced to ESP32 via BLE
3. Physical transaction is processed on ESP32
4. Transaction results are sent back to frontend
5. Sales data is stored in backend database

## Frontend Implementation

### Component Structure
The `MobileOperatorSalesBLE` component provides all necessary functionality:

#### Key Features
- Device discovery and connection management
- Real-time transaction data synchronization
- Auto-submit capability
- Comprehensive error handling
- User-friendly interface with visual feedback

#### State Management
The component maintains several important states:
- Bluetooth connection status
- Available devices list
- Transaction data
- Auto-submit preference
- Loading states

#### Bluetooth Communication
Communication with the ESP32 device follows a command-response pattern:

##### Outgoing Commands
- `GET_STATUS`: Request current device status
- `SET_TRANSACTION_DATA:{JSON}`: Send transaction data to device
- `TRANSACTION_SUCCESS:{id}`: Confirm successful transaction processing
- `TRANSACTION_ERROR:{message}`: Report transaction errors

##### Incoming Responses
- `SALE_DATA:{JSON}`: Transaction data from device
- `STATUS:{JSON}`: Device status information
- `TRANSACTION_DATA_SET:OK`: Confirmation of data receipt
- `ERROR:{message}`: Error messages from device

### UUID for Bluetooth Services
All Bluetooth communication uses the standard Serial Port Service UUID: `00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`

### Integration with Existing Systems
The BLE component seamlessly integrates with existing sales infrastructure:
- Uses the same API endpoints as manual sales
- Maintains consistent data structures
- Preserves existing authentication and authorization

## ESP32 Firmware Implementation

### Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 development board
- Push button (for manual transactions)
- LED indicator (for status feedback)
- Power supply

### Firmware Features
- Bluetooth Serial communication
- JSON data parsing and generation
- Transaction processing logic
- Status reporting capabilities

### Command Handling
The firmware processes various commands from the frontend:

#### GET_STATUS
Returns comprehensive device status including:
- Device readiness
- Current transaction data
- Transaction counter
- Device name

#### SET_TRANSACTION_DATA
Updates the device with new transaction data:
- Fuel type
- Liters
- Price per liter
- Calculated amount

#### Transaction Processing
When a transaction is initiated:
1. Data is validated
2. LED indicator provides visual feedback
3. Transaction counter is incremented
4. Results are sent back to frontend

## Backend Integration

### API Endpoints
The BLE feature uses existing sales endpoints:
- `POST /api/sales`: Create new sale transaction
- `GET /api/tanks`: Retrieve tank information
- `GET /api/prices`: Retrieve current fuel prices

### Data Consistency
All transactions, whether processed manually or via BLE, follow the same validation and processing logic:
- Stock level verification
- Transaction ID generation
- Tank stock updates
- Ledger recording

## Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites
1. ESP32 device with flashed firmware
2. Compatible web browser (Chrome, Edge)
3. Properly configured backend services
4. Valid user credentials with Operator role

### Device Setup
1. Flash the ESP32 with the provided firmware
2. Verify the device advertises as "ESP32_SalesDevice"
3. Connect physical components (button, LED)
4. Power on the device

### Application Configuration
1. Ensure Web Bluetooth is enabled in browser settings
2. Verify network connectivity to backend services
3. Log in with Operator credentials
4. Navigate to the BLE sales interface

## Usage Instructions

### Initial Connection
1. Open the sales operator interface
2. Click "Scan for Devices"
3. Wait for device discovery
4. Select the ESP32 device from the list
5. Click "Connect"
6. Verify connection status

### Processing Transactions
#### Manual Processing
1. Select fuel type from available options
2. Enter liters (supports decimal values)
3. Verify calculated amount
4. Process sale on physical device
5. Click "Create Sale" in the application

#### Auto-Submit Processing
1. Enable "Auto-submit transactions from device"
2. Select fuel type and enter liters
3. Process sale on physical device
4. Transaction is automatically created

### Status Monitoring
- Connection status is displayed visually
- Device readiness is indicated with color coding
- Transaction progress is shown with loading indicators

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Bluetooth Connection Problems
- **Symptom**: Unable to discover or connect to device
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify device is powered and advertising
  2. Check browser Bluetooth support
  3. Ensure Bluetooth permissions are granted
  4. Restart both device and application

#### Data Synchronization Errors
- **Symptom**: Transaction data not updating on device
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify connection status
  2. Check for JSON parsing errors in console
  3. Restart Bluetooth connection
  4. Validate transaction data format

#### Transaction Processing Failures
- **Symptom**: Sales not being recorded in system
- **Solution**:
  1. Check backend API connectivity
  2. Verify user permissions
  3. Review error messages in toast notifications
  4. Check backend logs for detailed error information

### Logging and Diagnostics
- Frontend console logs provide detailed communication information
- Device serial output shows processing steps
- Backend logs capture API interactions
- Toast notifications provide user feedback

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All communication is secured through HTTPS
- User authentication is required for all operations
- Transaction data is validated on both client and server
- Bluetooth communication follows standard security protocols
