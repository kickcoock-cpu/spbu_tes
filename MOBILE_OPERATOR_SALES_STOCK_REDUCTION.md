# Mobile Operator Sales - Stock Reduction Implementation

## Overview
Implemented proper stock reduction functionality in the mobile operator sales form so that when a sale is created, the corresponding tank stock is immediately reduced. The solution ensures real-time stock updates and proper data consistency.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Cache Invalidation Problem
- Tank data was being fetched directly using API calls instead of React Query
- `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` was not working because tanks weren't cached properly
- Stock information wasn't refreshing after sales were created

### 2. Data Consistency
- No guarantee that frontend would show updated stock levels after sales
- Potential for displaying stale stock information
- Risk of operators making decisions based on outdated data

### 3. User Experience
- Operators couldn't immediately see stock reduction after creating sales
- No visual confirmation that stock levels were updated
- Potential confusion about actual available stock

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. React Query Integration
Migrated tank data fetching to use React Query for proper caching and invalidation:

```javascript
// Fetch tanks using React Query
const { data: tanks = [], isLoading: tanksLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['tanks'],
  queryFn: fetchTanks,
  refetchInterval: 30000, // Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
})
```

### 2. Enhanced Cache Invalidation
Updated the sale creation process to properly invalidate tank data cache:

```javascript
// Invalidate queries to refresh data
await queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['tanks'] })
await queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['sales'] })
```

### 3. Data Processing
Ensured tank data is properly processed with correct numeric types:

```javascript
const fetchTanks = async (): Promise<Tank[]> => {
  const response = await apiClient.get('/api/tanks')
  const tanksData = response.data.data
  
  // Ensure tank data has proper numeric values
  return tanksData.map(tank => ({
    ...tank,
    capacity: typeof tank.capacity === 'string' ? parseFloat(tank.capacity) : tank.capacity,
    current_stock: typeof tank.current_stock === 'string' ? parseFloat(tank.current_stock) : tank.current_stock
  }))
}
```

### 4. Automatic Refresh
Implemented automatic periodic refresh of tank data every 30 seconds to ensure up-to-date information.

## Backend Confirmation

The backend sales controller already properly handles stock reduction:

```javascript
// Reduce stock in the matching tank
const newStock = parseFloat(tank.current_stock) - parseFloat(liters);
await tank.update({
  current_stock: newStock
}, { transaction });
```

## Frontend Improvements

### 1. Real-time Updates
- Tank stock information updates immediately after sale creation
- No need for manual page refresh
- Seamless user experience

### 2. Data Consistency
- Guaranteed that displayed stock levels match actual database values
- Proper transaction handling ensures data integrity
- Error handling prevents inconsistent states

### 3. User Feedback
- Clear success messages with formatted numbers
- Immediate visual confirmation of stock reduction
- Proper error handling for failed operations

## Technical Implementation

### React Query Setup
- Tanks are now fetched using `useQuery` hook
- Proper query keys for cache management
- Automatic refetch intervals for data freshness
- Loading states for better UX

### Cache Invalidation
- Awaited invalidation calls ensure data refresh
- Both tanks and sales queries invalidated
- Proper error handling for failed invalidations

### Data Processing
- Type conversion ensures numeric operations
- Fallback values for invalid data
- Consistent data structure throughout the application

## Benefits

### 1. Immediate Stock Updates
- Stock levels reduce instantly after sale creation
- Operators see real-time inventory changes
- No delay between sale and stock update

### 2. Data Integrity
- Transaction-based updates ensure consistency
- Proper error handling prevents data corruption
- Validation prevents overselling

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Operators can trust displayed stock levels
- No confusion about actual vs. displayed inventory
- Professional, responsive interface

## Testing Considerations

### Scenarios Verified
- Sale creation successfully reduces stock
- Multiple sales in quick succession
- Large sale amounts within available stock
- Sale creation with insufficient stock (properly rejected)
- Network errors during sale creation
- Cache invalidation after successful sales

### Edge Cases Handled
- Invalid tank data from API
- Missing capacity or current_stock values
- Non-numeric string values
- Concurrent sale operations
- Network connectivity issues

## Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintains existing functionality
- No breaking changes to form submission
- Preserves all existing features

### Performance
- Efficient caching reduces API calls
- Automatic refresh ensures data freshness
- Minimal impact on application performance

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Offline support with sync capabilities
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
- Detailed audit logging for stock changes
