# Mobile Deposits View Empty Space Fix

## Issue Description
The mobile deposits view had empty space on the right side, making the layout appear unbalanced and not fully utilizing the screen width.

## Root Cause Analysis
After thorough analysis, the issue was determined to be caused by:

1. **Incomplete CSS Class**: The CardHeader had an incomplete className (`pb-` instead of `pb-3`)
2. **Grid Layout Issues**: The grid layout was not properly calculating widths on mobile devices
3. **Padding Conflicts**: Inconsistent padding between containers and elements
4. **Width Calculation Problems**: Containers were not properly utilizing full screen width

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Incomplete CSS Class
Corrected the CardHeader className:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<CardHeader className="pb-">

<!-- After -->
<CardHeader className="pb-3">
```

### 2. Replaced Grid with Flexbox
Changed from grid to flexbox for better mobile control:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<div className="grid gap-2 grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4">

<!-- After -->
<div className="flex flex-col gap-3">
  <div className="flex gap-3">
    <div className="flex flex-col text-sm flex-1">
      <!-- First column -->
    </div>
    <div className="flex flex-col text-sm flex-1">
      <!-- Second column -->
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- More rows -->
</div>
```

### 3. Standardized Container Padding
Implemented consistent padding approach:
- Section title: `pt-2 px-2` with individual element padding
- Search bar: `px-2`
- Add deposit button: `px-2`
- Deposits list: `space-y-4 px-2`
- Cards: No additional margins (utilize container padding)

### 4. Full Width Utilization
Ensured all containers properly utilize available space:
- Main component: `flex flex-col gap-6 w-full`
- Parent container: `flex flex-col gap-6 w-full`
- Mobile layout main: `p-4 md:p-6 pt-4 pb-16 w-full`

## Files Modified
1. `/frontend/src/features/deposits-management/components/mobile-deposits-list.tsx`
2. `/frontend/src/features/deposits-management/deposits-management-page.tsx`
3. `/frontend/src/components/layout/mobile-layout.tsx`

## Layout Structure
The new flexbox approach:
- Row 1: Amount | Method
- Row 2: Operator | ID
- Row 3: Approved By (full width)
- Row 4: Rejected By (full width)

## Result
The mobile deposits view now properly utilizes the full screen width without empty spaces on the right side. The layout provides a balanced and professional appearance on all mobile devices while maintaining all the necessary information display.

## Technical Details
This approach uses flexbox instead of grid because:
1. **Better Mobile Support**: Flexbox has more consistent behavior on mobile browsers
2. **Simpler Width Calculation**: Flexbox naturally fills available space
3. **More Predictable**: Flexbox behavior is more predictable on mobile devices
4. **Easier Debugging**: Flexbox issues are easier to identify and fix

The fix ensures that:
- All information is properly displayed without empty spaces
- The layout is responsive and works well on different mobile screen sizes
- Visual hierarchy is maintained for easy scanning of deposit information
- Component widths are properly calculated without conflicts
- Design remains consistent with other mobile views in the application
