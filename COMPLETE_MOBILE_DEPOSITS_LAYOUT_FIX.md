# Complete Mobile Deposits View Layout Fix

## Issue Description
The mobile deposits view had persistent empty space on the right side, making the layout appear unbalanced despite multiple fixes.

## Root Cause Analysis
After extensive analysis, the issue was determined to be caused by:

1. **Layout Calculation Issues**: The grid layout was not properly calculating widths
2. **Excessive Padding**: Card headers had excessive bottom padding (`pb-9`)
3. **Width Constraints**: Parent containers didn't have proper width constraints
4. **Overflow Issues**: Components didn't have proper overflow handling

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Replaced Grid Layout with Flexbox
Changed from grid to flexbox for better width control:
```html
<!-- Before -->
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 w-full">

<!-- After -->
<div className="flex flex-col gap-3 w-full">
  <div className="flex gap-3">
    <div className="flex flex-col text-sm flex-1">
      <!-- First column -->
    </div>
    <div className="flex flex-col text-sm flex-1">
      <!-- Second column -->
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- More rows -->
</div>
```

### 2. Reduced Excessive Padding
Reduced card header padding from `pb-9` to `pb-3`:
```html
<CardHeader className="pb-3">
```

### 3. Added Width Constraints
Ensured all containers use proper width constraints:
- Main container: `w-full max-w-full overflow-hidden`
- Parent containers: `w-full max-w-full overflow-hidden`
- Cards: `w-full overflow-hidden`

### 4. Improved Spacing
- Maintained horizontal margins on cards (`mx-4`)
- Kept element-specific padding for visual consistency
- Reduced gap sizes for better mobile utilization

## Files Modified
1. `/frontend/src/features/deposits-management/components/mobile-deposits-list.tsx`
2. `/frontend/src/features/deposits-management/deposits-management-page.tsx`
3. `/frontend/src/components/layout/mobile-layout.tsx`

## Layout Structure
The new flexbox approach:
- Row 1: Amount | Method
- Row 2: Operator | ID
- Row 3: Approved By (full width)
- Row 4: Rejected By (full width)

## Result
The mobile deposits view now properly utilizes the full screen width without empty spaces on the right side. The layout provides a balanced and professional appearance on all mobile devices while maintaining all the necessary information display.

## Technical Details
This approach uses flexbox instead of grid because:
1. **Better Browser Support**: Flexbox has more consistent behavior across mobile browsers
2. **Simpler Width Calculation**: Flexbox naturally fills available space
3. **More Predictable**: Flexbox behavior is more predictable on mobile devices
4. **Easier Debugging**: Flexbox issues are easier to identify and fix

The fix ensures that:
- All information is properly displayed without empty spaces
- The layout is responsive and works well on different mobile screen sizes
- Visual hierarchy is maintained for easy scanning of deposit information
- Component widths are properly calculated without conflicts
- Design remains consistent with other mobile views in the application
- Overflow issues are prevented with `overflow-hidden` classes
