# Desktop Profile Navbar Enhancement - Sidebar Cleanup

## Overview
This document describes the cleanup of duplicate profile elements in the sidebar to ensure the profile dropdown only appears in the header.

## Changes Made

### 1. Sidebar Cleanup
Removed the `NavUser` component from the sidebar footer to avoid duplication with the header profile dropdown. This ensures:
- Single source of profile access in the header
- Cleaner sidebar without redundant user information
- Consistent user experience across devices

### 2. Header Profile Enhancement
The profile dropdown in the header remains enhanced with:
- User avatar
- User name and role display for desktop
- Full dropdown menu with profile options
- Consistent positioning in the top-right corner

## Implementation Details

### Before
```jsx
{/* Footer with user info - hidden on mobile */}
{!isMobile && (
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-2 p-2">
    <NavUser user={sidebarData.user} />
  </div>
)}
```

### After
```jsx
{/* Footer - removed user info to avoid duplication with header profile */}
{!isMobile && (
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-2 p-2">
    {/* Profile moved to header to avoid duplication */}
  </div>
)}
```
