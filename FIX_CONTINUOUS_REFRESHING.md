# Fix for Continuous Refreshing in Mobile Operator Sales

## Issues Identified

### 1. Unused Loading State
- The component had an unused `loading` state that was never set to `false`
- This caused confusion in the loading condition check
- The old loading state was from the previous implementation before React Query

### 2. Auto-refresh Interval
- React Query was configured with `refetchInterval: 30000` (30 seconds)
- This caused the component to continuously re-render every 30 seconds
- This was creating the "muter-muter" (continuous refreshing) behavior
- Unnecessary for this use case since we manually invalidate queries when needed

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Unused Loading State
```javascript
// Before (problematic)
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true) // Never set to false

// After (fixed)
// Removed the unused loading state entirely
```

### 2. Updated Loading Condition
```javascript
// Before (problematic)
if (loading || tanksLoading || pricesLoading) {

// After (fixed)
if (tanksLoading || pricesLoading) {
```

### 3. Removed Auto-refresh Interval
```javascript
// Before (problematic)
const { data: tanks = [], isLoading: tanksLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['tanks'],
  queryFn: fetchTanks,
  refetchInterval: 30000, // Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
})

// After (fixed)
const { data: tanks = [], isLoading: tanksLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['tanks'],
  queryFn: fetchTanks,
  // Removed refetchInterval to prevent continuous refreshing
})
```

## Why These Fixes Work

### 1. Proper State Management
- Eliminated unused state variables that were causing confusion
- Simplified the loading logic to only depend on React Query's loading states
- Removed redundant state that was never properly managed

### 2. Controlled Data Refreshing
- Removed automatic periodic refresh that was causing continuous re-renders
- Kept manual query invalidation for when data actually needs to be refreshed
- Better performance by avoiding unnecessary API calls

### 3. Better User Experience
- Component no longer refreshes continuously
- Data still updates when sales are created (through manual invalidation)
- Loading states work correctly
- No more "muter-muter" behavior

## Benefits

### 1. Performance Improvement
- Eliminates unnecessary re-renders every 30 seconds
- Reduces API calls and network traffic
- Better battery life on mobile devices

### 2. Stability
- Component loads properly and stays loaded
- No more infinite refresh loops
- Predictable behavior

### 3. Maintainability
- Cleaner code with fewer state variables
- Clearer loading logic
- Easier to understand and modify

## Testing

The component should now:
- Load properly without continuous refreshing
- Show loading spinner only during initial data fetch
- Update tank data when sales are created
- Not re-render every 30 seconds
- Provide a stable user experience
