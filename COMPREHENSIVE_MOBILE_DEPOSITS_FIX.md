# Comprehensive Mobile Deposits View Empty Space Fix

## Issue Description
The mobile deposits view had persistent empty space on the right side, making the layout appear unbalanced despite previous fixes.

## Root Cause Analysis
After thorough analysis, the issue was determined to be caused by:

1. **Padding Conflicts**: The main content area uses `p-4` padding, while the deposits list component also uses `px-4` padding, creating visual inconsistencies
2. **Width Calculation Issues**: Components were not properly accounting for parent container padding in their width calculations
3. **Grid Layout Constraints**: The grid layout was not fully utilizing the available space due to container constraints

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Padding Conflict Resolution
Modified the deposits list container to use negative margins to counteract parent padding:
```html
<div className="px-4 -mx-4 flex flex-col gap-4 pb-20">
```

This approach:
- Maintains the visual padding effect
- Counteracts the parent container's padding
- Ensures proper width utilization without conflicts

### 2. Grid Layout Enhancement
Enhanced the grid layout to ensure proper width utilization:
```html
<div className="w-full">
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 w-full">
    <!-- Grid items -->
  </div>
</div>
```

This ensures:
- The grid container takes full width
- Grid items properly distribute across available space
- Consistent spacing between elements

### 3. Component Width Optimization
Ensured all components properly utilize available space:
- Main container: `w-full` to take full available width
- Cards: `w-full` to expand within their container
- Grid container: `w-full` to utilize card space

### 4. Consistent Spacing Approach
Maintained consistent padding approach across all components:
- Section title: `px-4 pt-2`
- Search bar: `px-4`
- Add deposit button: `px-4`
- Deposits list: `px-4 -mx-4`

## Files Modified
1. `/frontend/src/features/deposits-management/components/mobile-deposits-list.tsx`
2. `/frontend/src/components/layout/mobile-layout.tsx` (reverted to original state)

## Layout Structure
The grid layout was maintained as:
- Row 1: Amount | Method
- Row 2: Operator | ID
- Row 3: Approved By (spans 2 columns)
- Row 4: Rejected By (spans 2 columns)

## Result
The mobile deposits view now properly utilizes the full screen width without empty spaces on the right side. The layout provides a balanced and professional appearance on all mobile devices while maintaining all the necessary information display.

The fix ensures that:
- All information is properly displayed without empty spaces
- The layout is responsive and works well on different mobile screen sizes
- The visual hierarchy is maintained for easy scanning of deposit information
- Component widths are properly calculated without padding conflicts
- The design remains consistent with other mobile views in the application

## Technical Details
The negative margin approach (`-mx-4`) effectively cancels out the horizontal padding (`px-4`) from the parent container, allowing the content to properly utilize the full width while maintaining the visual padding effect. This is a common technique in CSS for handling nested padding conflicts.
