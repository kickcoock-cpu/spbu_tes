# User CRUD RBAC Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for the user CRUD pages in the application. The implementation ensures that users can only perform actions according to their role permissions as defined in the RBAC configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Changes

#### a. RBAC Utility Functions
- Created `src/lib/rbac.ts` with utility functions for checking user permissions
- Implemented functions for checking full access, read-only access, limited access, and any access
- Centralized RBAC logic for easier maintenance

#### b. Users Page (`src/features/users/index.tsx`)
- Updated to use the new RBAC utility functions
- Implemented proper access control based on user permissions
- Super Admins: Full access (create, read, update, delete)
- Admins: Read-only access (view only)
- Operators: No access (redirected to dashboard)

#### c. Users Table Component (`src/features/users/components/users-table.tsx`)
- Modified to accept a `readOnly` prop
- Passes the `readOnly` prop to row actions and bulk actions components
- Updated column definitions to use a function that accepts the `readOnly` prop

#### d. Data Table Row Actions (`src/features/users/components/data-table-row-actions.tsx`)
- Updated to accept and respect the `readOnly` prop
- Hides edit and delete actions when in read-only mode

#### e. Data Table Bulk Actions (`src/features/users/components/data-table-bulk-actions.tsx`)
- Updated to accept and respect the `readOnly` prop
- Hides all bulk actions when in read-only mode

#### f. Users Primary Buttons (`src/features/users/components/users-primary-buttons.tsx`)
- Updated to accept and respect the `readOnly` prop
- Hides the "Add User" button when in read-only mode

### 2. Backend Changes

#### a. Users Routes (`backend/routes/users.js`)
- Updated to use the RBAC middleware instead of the basic auth middleware
- Ensures more granular permission checking

#### b. RBAC Middleware (`backend/middleware/rbac.js`)
- Enhanced to properly extract resource from URL
- Improved permission checking logic
- Ensures Admins can only read user data, not modify it

## RBAC Permissions Implemented

Based on the RBAC configuration in `MENU_RBAC.md`:

1. **Super Admin**
   - Full access to all user operations (create, read, update, delete)

2. **Admin**
   - Read-only access to user data (view only)

3. **Operator**
   - No access to user management (redirected to dashboard)

## Testing

The implementation should be tested with different user roles to ensure:
1. Super Admins can perform all CRUD operations
2. Admins can only view user data
3. Operators cannot access the user management page
4. Proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts

## Future Improvements

1. Add unit tests for RBAC utility functions
2. Implement more granular permissions for other resources
3. Add audit logging for user management operations
