- Added proper padding (`px-4`) to container elements for better visual balance
- Improved card layout with better vertical rhythm using `flex flex-col gap-4`
- Enhanced responsive text sizing and truncation with `min-w-0` for proper text wrapping

#### Touch Target Optimization
- Increased touch target sizes with `py-5` for buttons and form controls
- Added appropriate spacing between interactive elements with `gap-3`
- Improved visual feedback for interactive elements

#### Visual Design Enhancements
- Added consistent shadow styling (`shadow-sm`) to cards for better depth perception
- Improved badge styling with `whitespace-nowrap` for better text handling
- Enhanced empty state design with better visual hierarchy

### 2. Optimized MobileUserForm Component

- Improved input sizing with `py-5` for better touch targets
- Added min-width constraints (`min-w-[50px]`) for better text alignment
- Implemented shadow styling (`shadow-sm`) for better depth perception

### Component Refinements

#### MobileUserList
```jsx
// Enhanced spacing and layout
<div className="flex flex-col gap-6">
  {/* Content */}
</div>

// Improved card layout
<Card className="overflow-hidden shadow-sm">
  <CardHeader className="pb-3">
    <div className="flex justify-between items-start">
      <div className="flex flex-col min-w-0">
        <CardTitle className="text-lg truncate">{user.name}</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription className="text-sm mt-1">@{user.username}</CardDescription>
      </div>
      <Badge 
        variant={user.is_active ? "default" : "destructive"}
        className="text-xs whitespace-nowrap"
      >
        {user.is_active ? 'Active' : 'Inactive'}
      </Badge>
    </div>
  </CardHeader>
  {/* Rest of component */}
</Card>
```

#### MobileUserForm Header
```jsx
// Enhanced header with balanced layout
<div className="flex items-center justify-between pt-2">
  <Button variant="ghost" size="icon" onClick={onCancel} className="h-10 w-10">
    <ChevronLeft className="h-5 w-5" />
  </Button>
  <div className="flex-1 text-center px-4">
    <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">
      {isEditing ? 'Edit User' : 'Create User'}
    </h1>
    <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm mt-1">
      {isEditing 
        ? 'Update user information' 
        : 'Add a new user to the system'}
    </p>
  </div>
  <div className="w-10"></div> {/* Spacer for symmetry */}
</div>
```

### Accessibility Improvements
- Added proper ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Improved color contrast ratios for better readability
- Enhanced focus states for keyboard navigation
- Better semantic HTML structure for screen readers
- Increased touch target sizes for better usability

## Testing Results
