# Desktop Profile Navbar Enhancement

## Overview
This document describes the enhancements made to the desktop profile navbar to improve visibility and user experience for desktop users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced ProfileDropdown Component
The `ProfileDropdown` component was enhanced to provide a more prominent and user-friendly experience on desktop while maintaining the existing mobile experience.

#### Desktop Enhancements
- Increased button size for better visibility (`h-10` instead of `h-8`)
- Added user name and role display alongside the avatar
- Improved hover states with `hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground`
- Added padding for better touch targets (`px-2 py-1`)
- Maintained consistent dropdown menu styling

#### Mobile Experience
- Kept the existing compact design for mobile users
- Preserved all mobile-specific styling and positioning
- Maintained touch-friendly sizing and spacing

### 2. Visual Improvements
- Enhanced visual hierarchy with user name and role displayed in the button
- Improved accessibility with better contrast and sizing
- Consistent styling with the application's design system

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```jsx
// Desktop version (enhanced)
<Button 
  variant='ghost' 
  className='relative h-10 rounded-full px-2 py-1 hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground'
>
  <div className='flex items-center gap-2'>
    <Avatar className='h-8 w-8'>
      <AvatarImage src='/avatars/01.png' alt={getDisplayName()} />
      <AvatarFallback>{getUserInitials()}</AvatarFallback>
    </Avatar>
    <div className='hidden md:flex flex-col items-start gap-0.5'>
      <span className='text-sm font-medium leading-none'>{getDisplayName()}</span>
      <span className='text-xs text-muted-foreground leading-none'>
        {getUserRoles()[0]}
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
</Button>

// Mobile version (unchanged)
<Button 
  variant='ghost' 
  className='relative h-8 w-8 rounded-full p-0'
>
  <Avatar className='h-8 w-8'>
    <AvatarImage src='/avatars/01.png' alt={getDisplayName()} />
    <AvatarFallback>{getUserInitials()}</AvatarFallback>
  </Avatar>
</Button>
```

### Conditional Rendering
The component now uses conditional rendering to provide different experiences for desktop and mobile:
- Desktop: Enhanced profile button with user name and role
- Mobile: Compact avatar-only button (preserving existing mobile experience)

## Testing Results

### Performance Optimizations
