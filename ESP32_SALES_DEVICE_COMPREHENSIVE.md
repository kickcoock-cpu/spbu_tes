# ESP32 Sales Transaction Device - Comprehensive Guide

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing ESP32-based sales transaction devices. Two communication methods are supported:
1. Bluetooth (for local communication with mobile app)
2. WiFi (for direct communication with backend API)

## Comparison of Communication Methods

### Bluetooth Implementation
**Advantages:**
- Works without internet connection
- Lower latency for real-time interaction
- Better for mobile app integration
- More secure (no network exposure)

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited range (typically 10 meters)
- Requires paired device (mobile app)
- More complex implementation in browser

**Use Cases:**
- Mobile operators using smartphones/tablets
- Environments with limited or no internet connectivity
- Applications requiring real-time interaction

### WiFi Implementation
**Advantages:**
- Longer range (network-limited)
- Direct communication with backend
- No need for intermediary device
- Simpler implementation (no pairing)

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires internet/WiFi connectivity
- Security considerations for token storage
- Less real-time interaction capability

**Use Cases:**
- Fixed installations with reliable WiFi
- Applications where direct API communication is preferred
- Environments where mobile devices are not used

## Setup Instructions

### For Bluetooth Implementation
1. Flash `esp32_sales_transaction.ino` to ESP32
2. Use MobileOperatorSales component in the frontend
3. Pair device with mobile app via Bluetooth

### For WiFi Implementation
1. Flash `esp32_sales_transaction_wifi.ino` to ESP32
2. Configure WiFi credentials and API endpoint
3. Ensure secure token management

## Security Recommendations
1. Never store JWT tokens in plain text in production
2. Implement token refresh mechanisms
3. Use HTTPS for WiFi implementation
4. Validate all data received from ESP32 devices
5. Implement device authentication/authorization

## Testing
1. Verify device connectivity (Bluetooth pairing or WiFi connection)
2. Test data transmission accuracy
3. Validate transaction processing in backend
4. Check error handling and edge cases

## Maintenance
1. Regular firmware updates
2. Monitor device connectivity
3. Update authentication tokens as needed
4. Check hardware components periodically
