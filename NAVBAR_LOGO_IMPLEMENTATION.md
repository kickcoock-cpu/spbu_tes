## Implementation Details

### Logo Component
The `SimontoKLogo` component is a reusable SVG component that:
- Accepts a `size` prop for flexible sizing
- Includes visual elements representing:
  - Fuel tank
  - Fuel level indicator
  - Fuel pump
  - Monitoring icon
  - Letter "S" for SimontoK
- Uses a consistent color scheme with blue gradients

### Styling
All navbar logos use:
- Drop shadow effect for depth
- Consistent sizing (32px for navbar, 24px for sidebar)
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Testing

To test the navbar logo implementation:
1. View the application on desktop and verify the logo appears in the top navbar
2. Check that the mobile version also displays the logo correctly
3. Verify that the sidebar navigation still shows the logo
4. Confirm that all text descriptions are visible and properly formatted
5. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

## Future Improvements

1. Add animation effects to the logo on hover
2. Implement dark mode support for the logo
3. Consider adding a tooltip with application information
4. Add localization support for the descriptive text
