# Mobile Operator Sales Form - Full Width Optimization

## Overview
Optimized the mobile operator sales form for proper full-width display on mobile devices without requiring zooming. The changes ensure the form utilizes the entire screen width while maintaining proper spacing and touch targets.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Full-Width Card Layout
- **Removed side margins**: Changed `mx-4` to `mx-0` for full-width card on mobile
- **Responsive rounding**: Added `rounded-none sm:rounded-lg` for proper mobile/desktop display
- **Full-width container**: Added `w-full max-w-full` to the main container

### 2. Enhanced Touch Targets
- **Larger input fields**: Increased height from `h-10` to `h-12` with larger padding
- **Bigger text**: Changed from `text-sm` to `text-base` for better readability
- **Larger buttons**: Increased button height and font size for easier tapping
- **Improved select trigger**: Larger select trigger with better padding

### 3. Improved Spacing and Padding
- **Increased card header padding**: Added `pt-5` for better visual spacing
- **Enhanced section padding**: Increased padding around form elements
- **Better grid spacing**: Increased gap from `gap-3` to `gap-4` in the stock status grid

### 4. Mobile-Optimized Typography
- **Larger text sizes**: Increased text sizes for better readability on small screens
- **Better line heights**: Adjusted padding and heights for optimal text display

### 5. Responsive Design Improvements
