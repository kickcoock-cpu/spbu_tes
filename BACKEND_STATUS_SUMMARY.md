# SPBU Backend - Current Status and Next Steps

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks
1. **Database Configuration**: Successfully configured PostgreSQL connection with Supabase
2. **Environment Variables**: Updated all configuration files with correct credentials
3. **SSL Configuration**: Fixed SSL certificate issues in development environment
4. **Migrations**: Successfully applied all database migrations
5. **Partial Seeding**: Seeded some data to the database
6. **API Endpoint**: Login endpoint is accessible and functional

### ❌ Outstanding Issues
1. **SSL Certificate in Production**: The "self-signed certificate in certificate chain" error is still occurring in the production environment
2. **Incomplete Seeding**: Some seed data failed to load due to schema mismatches

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix Production SSL Issue
- Verify Vercel deployment completed successfully
- Check Vercel environment variables match our updated configuration
- Ensure `rejectUnauthorized: false` is properly set in production
- Redeploy if necessary

### 2. Complete Data Seeding
- Fix seed data files to match current database schema
- Rerun seeders to populate all test data
- Verify seeded user accounts work correctly

### 3. Test Login Functionality
- Once SSL issue is resolved, test login with seeded accounts:
  - Super Admin: superadmin@spbu.com / password123
  - Admin: admin1@spbu.com / password123
  - Operator: operator1@spbu.com / password123

## Expected Outcome
After resolving the SSL certificate issue, the login functionality should work with the seeded user accounts, allowing full testing of the application's authentication and authorization features.
