# User Management Route Migration

## Overview
This document explains the migration from the old `/users` route to the new `/user-management` route with proper RBAC implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Route Structure
- **Removed**: Old `/users` route in `src/routes/_authenticated/users/`
- **Added**: New `/user-management` route in `src/routes/_authenticated/user-management/`

### 2. Route Configuration
The new route configuration properly implements RBAC:

1. **Route Guard**: `/user-management/route.tsx` checks user authentication and permissions before loading
2. **RBAC Integration**: Uses `hasAccess()` function to check if user can access user management
3. **Proper Redirects**: 
   - Unauthenticated users redirected to `/sign-in`
   - Unauthorized users redirected to `/`

### 3. Component Updates
- **User Management Page**: Updated `src/features/user-management/user-management-page.tsx` to implement proper RBAC
- **Permission Checks**: 
  - Super Admins: Full access (create, read, update, delete)
  - Admins: Read-only access
  - Operators: No access (redirected)

### 4. RBAC Implementation
The user management page now properly implements RBAC:

- **Full Access Users** (Super Admins):
  - Can create, edit, and delete users
  - See all action buttons and dialogs

- **Read-Only Users** (Admins):
  - Can only view users
  - Action buttons and dialogs are hidden
  - Clear messaging about read-only access

- **No Access Users** (Operators):
  - Redirected to home page
  - Cannot access the user management page at all

### 5. API Integration
- Uses the same backend API endpoints (`/api/users`)
- Proper error handling with React Query
- Loading states and user feedback with toast notifications

## Testing
To test the implementation:

1. **Super Admin**: Should have full access to all user management features
2. **Admin**: Should only be able to view users (read-only mode)
3. **Operator**: Should be redirected to home page when trying to access `/user-management`

## URL Changes
- **Old**: `/users` 
- **New**: `/user-management`

Update any bookmarks or links to use the new URL.

## Benefits
1. **Proper RBAC**: Implements role-based access control as defined in MENU_RBAC.md
2. **Better UX**: Clear messaging for different permission levels
3. **Security**: Proper authentication and authorization checks
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner code structure and separation of concerns
