# Password Standardization and Login Fix - Summary

## Issue
The SPBU Management System had inconsistent passwords across different seed files and documentation, making it difficult to log in to the system. Users were getting "Invalid credentials" errors even when using what appeared to be correct passwords.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Multiple seed files used different passwords:
   - Regular seeder: `password123`
   - Supabase seeder: `Pertamina1*`
2. Documentation was inconsistent with actual database content
3. The deployed backend was likely using a different password than what was documented

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Password Standardization
- Standardized on `Pertamina1*` as the password for all users
- Updated all seed files to use this standardized password
- Updated documentation to reflect the standardized password

### 2. Database Password Update
Since we couldn't run the seeder due to database connection issues, we directly updated all user passwords in the Supabase database using the REST API:

1. Generated a bcrypt hash for the standardized password `Pertamina1*`
2. Updated each user's password hash in the database:
   - Super Admin (ID: 1)
   - Admin Pusat (ID: 2)
   - Admin Cabang (ID: 3)
   - Operator Pusat 1 (ID: 4)
   - Operator Pusat 2 (ID: 5)
   - Operator Cabang 1 (ID: 6)
   - Operator Cabang 2 (ID: 7)

### 3. Login Verification
Successfully verified login works for all user types with the standardized password:

1. **Super Admin**: 
   - Username: `superadmin`
   - Email: `superadmin@spbu.com`
   - Password: `Pertamina1*`

2. **Admins**:
   - Usernames: `admin1`, `admin2`
   - Emails: `admin1@spbu.com`, `admin2@spbu.com`
   - Password: `Pertamina1*`

3. **Operators**:
   - Usernames: `operator1a`, `operator1b`, `operator2a`, `operator2b`
   - Emails: `operator1a@spbu.com`, `operator1b@spbu.com`, etc.
   - Password: `Pertamina1*`

## Files Updated
1. `backend/seeders/20230101000002-users-fixed.js` - New unified seed file
2. `backend/seeders/20230101000002-users.js` - Updated original seed file
3. `backend/seeders/supabase-seeder.js` - Updated Supabase seeder
4. `backend/README.md` - Updated documentation
5. `backend/API_DOCS.md` - Updated documentation
6. `backend/scripts/live-sale-test.js` - Updated test script
7. `backend/scripts/sale-test.js` - Updated test script
8. `backend/resetPassword.js` - Updated reset password script
9. Created `PASSWORD_STANDARDIZATION.md` - New documentation

## Verification
All login attempts now return successful responses with JWT tokens:
```
{
  "success": true,
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Super Admin",
    "username": "superadmin",
    "email": "superadmin@spbu.com",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Conclusion
The password standardization has been successfully implemented and verified. All users can now log in using the standardized password `Pertamina1*` with either their username or email.
