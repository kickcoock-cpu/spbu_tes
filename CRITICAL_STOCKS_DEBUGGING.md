# Critical Stocks Debugging and Fix

## Issue
The critical stocks calculation was not working correctly in the dashboard. Even when tanks had low fuel levels, the dashboard showed "Critical Stocks: 0".

## Investigation
Added extensive logging to identify the root cause:

### Backend Changes
1. Added detailed console logs in the dashboard controller to track:
   - Tank data (current stock, capacity)
   - Fill percentage calculations
   - Days until stockout calculations
   - Final stock predictions array

2. Added logging for both user roles:
   - Super Admin (all tanks)
   - Admin/Operator (SPBU-specific tanks)

### Frontend Changes
1. Added console logs to track:
   - Incoming stock prediction data
   - Days until stockout values and their types
   - Critical stock filtering results
   - Final critical stocks count

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was likely related to:
1. Data type mismatches (string vs number)
2. Incorrect parsing of tank capacity and current stock values
3. Logic errors in the fill percentage calculation

## Solution
Enhanced the debugging capabilities to identify and fix the issue:

1. **Backend Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track the entire calculation process
2. **Data Type Verification**: Ensured proper parsing of decimal values from the database
3. **Frontend Debugging**: Added client-side logging to verify filtering logic

## Files Modified
- `backend/controllers/dashboardController.js` - Added extensive logging
- `frontend/src/features/dashboard/components/dashboard-overview.tsx` - Added debugging logs

## Next Steps
With these debugging enhancements in place, the actual issue can be identified by:
1. Starting the backend server
2. Accessing the dashboard as a user
3. Checking the console logs for:
   - Tank data values
   - Fill percentage calculations
   - Days until stockout assignments
   - Critical stock filtering results

The logs will reveal exactly where the calculation is failing, allowing for a targeted fix.
