# Enhanced Demand Prediction Algorithm Design

## Current Limitations
1. Only calculates average sales by day of week
2. No consideration of seasonal trends or special events
3. No price sensitivity analysis
4. No weather pattern integration
5. No confidence scoring
6. No trend analysis
7. Limited fuel type support

## Enhanced Algorithm Features

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- Day of week patterns
- Seasonal variations
- Monthly trends
- Holiday effects
- Special events

### 2. External Factor Integration
- Weather patterns (temperature, rain, etc.)
- Price changes and promotions
- Local events and activities
- Economic indicators

### 3. Advanced Statistical Methods
- Moving averages for trend detection
- Exponential smoothing for recent trends
- Regression analysis for pattern recognition
- Confidence interval calculations

### 4. Machine Learning Approaches
- Time series forecasting models
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Anomaly detection

### 5. Enhanced Data Structure

## Implementation Plan

### Backend Enhancements
1. Create `backend/utils/demand-prediction.js` with enhanced algorithms
2. Modify `getDemandPrediction` function in `predictionController.js`
3. Add support for additional fuel types
4. Integrate with external data sources (weather, events)
5. Add configurable parameters for tuning

### Frontend Enhancements
1. Update UI to show enhanced information
2. Add trend indicators
3. Display confidence with visual indicators
4. Show seasonal factors
5. Add comparison with last year's data
6. Include variance information

### Data Sources to Integrate
1. Historical sales data (current)
2. Weather data APIs
3. Local event calendars
4. Price history data
5. Economic indicators
6. Holiday schedules
