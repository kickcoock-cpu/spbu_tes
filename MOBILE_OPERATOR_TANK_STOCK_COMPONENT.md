# Mobile Operator Tank Stock Component

## Overview
This component displays the remaining stock tanks for mobile sales operators with their relationships. It provides a mobile-friendly interface for operators to view current fuel levels in tanks assigned to their SPBU.

## Features
1. **Real-time Tank Stock Display**: Shows current stock levels for all tanks in the operator's assigned SPBU
2. **Search Functionality**: Allows operators to search for specific tanks by name, fuel type, or SPBU
3. **Visual Status Indicators**: 
   - Critical (red): < 20% fill level
   - Low (yellow): 20-49% fill level
   - Normal (blue): 50-79% fill level
   - Good (green): â‰¥ 80% fill level
4. **Tank Details**: Displays tank name, fuel type, current stock, capacity, and SPBU information
5. **Visual Progress Bar**: Shows fill level with a color-coded progress bar
6. **Auto-refresh**: Updates data every 30 seconds to ensure operators have current information

## Component Structure
- **File**: `frontend/src/features/tanks/components/mobile-operator-tank-stock.tsx`
- **Props**:

## Data Flow

4. Applies status colors based on fill levels
5. Filters tanks based on search term

import { MobileOperatorTankStock } from '@/features/tanks/components/mobile-operator-tank-stock'

<MobileOperatorTankStock 
  onTankSelect={(tank) => console.log('Selected tank:', tank)} 
/>
