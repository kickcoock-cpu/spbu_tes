# Critical Stocks Card Issue Analysis

## Current Status
The Critical Stocks Card is still showing "0" even though there should be critical stocks.

## Debugging Steps Implemented

1. **API Response Logging**: Added logging in dashboard-page.tsx to capture the raw API response
2. **Dashboard Data Logging**: Added comprehensive logging in dashboard-overview.tsx to see what data is being received
3. **Critical Stocks Filtering**: Enhanced the filtering logic with detailed logging
4. **Data Type Handling**: Improved handling of different data types for daysUntilStockout
5. **Edge Case Handling**: Added checks for invalid data, NaN, and infinite values
6. **Component Props Logging**: Added logging to see what values are being passed to SummaryStats

## What We Need to Check

1. **Is dashboardData being received?**
   - Check if dashboardData is null/undefined
   - Check if stockPredictions property exists
   - Check if stockPredictions is an array

2. **What does the stockPredictions data look like?**
   - Check the structure of each stock prediction entry
   - Check the values of daysUntilStockout
   - Check the data types of daysUntilStockout

3. **Why is the filtering returning 0?**
   - Are all daysUntilStockout values > 5?
   - Are there any NaN or invalid values?
   - Is the filtering logic working correctly?

## Next Steps

1. Check the browser console output to see what's being logged
2. Identify the specific issue based on the logs
3. Implement a targeted fix

## Potential Issues

1. **All daysUntilStockout values are > 5**: This would mean there are actually no critical stocks
2. **Data type issues**: daysUntilStockout might be coming as strings or other types
3. **Invalid data**: daysUntilStockout might be NaN, null, or undefined
4. **Empty data**: stockPredictions array might be empty
5. **Structure issues**: The data structure might not match what we expect
