# Critical Stocks Card - Debugging Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. API Response Logging (dashboard-page.tsx)
- Added logging to capture the raw API response
- Logs the complete dashboard data structure

### 2. Dashboard Data Analysis (dashboard-overview.tsx)
- Added comprehensive logging to see what data is being received
- Added checks for data structure and property existence
- Added property name inspection to handle potential serialization issues

### 3. Critical Stocks Filtering Enhancement (dashboard-overview.tsx)
- Enhanced filtering logic with detailed logging
- Added robust data type handling for daysUntilStockout
- Added property name detection to handle case sensitivity issues
- Added comprehensive validation for edge cases

### 4. Component Props Logging (dashboard-overview.tsx)
- Added logging to see what values are being passed to SummaryStats

## What to Look for in Console Logs

### 1. API Response Structure
Look for logs showing:
```
=== RAW API RESPONSE ===
Response data: { ... }
Dashboard data: { ... }
Stock predictions: [ ... ]
```

### 2. Dashboard Data Analysis
Look for logs showing:
```
=== DASHBOARD OVERVIEW ===
Dashboard data received: { ... }
Stock predictions: [ ... ]
Stock predictions length: X
```

### 3. Critical Stocks Filtering Details
Look for logs showing:
```
=== CRITICAL STOCKS FILTERING ===
Processing X stock predictions
[0] Stock entry: { ... }
[0] Object keys: [ ... ]
[0] daysUntilStockout: Y
[0] daysUntilStockout type: Z
```

### 4. Property Name Issues
If there's a property name mismatch, look for:
```
[0] daysUntilStockout property NOT found in stock object
[0] Possible alternative property: someOtherName = value
```

### 5. Filtering Results
Look for logs showing:
```
--- Checking stock: FuelName ---
Property name used: daysUntilStockout
Raw daysUntilStockout: 3
Type of daysUntilStockout: number
Converted days: 3
Is NaN: false
Is Finite: true
Is Critical: true (days: 3)
Filtered critical stocks count: X
```

## Potential Issues to Identify

1. **Missing Property**: daysUntilStockout might not exist in the data
2. **Wrong Property Name**: Property might be named differently (e.g., days_until_stockout)
3. **Data Type Issues**: daysUntilStockout might be a string instead of number
4. **Invalid Values**: daysUntilStockout might be NaN, null, or undefined
5. **All Values > 5**: All daysUntilStockout values might actually be greater than 5
6. **Empty Array**: stockPredictions array might be empty

## Next Steps After Checking Logs

1. **If property is missing or named differently**: Update the property access logic
2. **If all values are > 5**: This is working correctly - there are no actual critical stocks
3. **If data types are wrong**: Add more robust type conversion
4. **If array is empty**: Check why no stock predictions are being returned from backend
