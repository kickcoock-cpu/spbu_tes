# Mobile Navbar Profile Layout Fix

## Issue Description
The mobile navbar profile layout was not clickable, preventing users from accessing the profile dropdown menu on mobile devices. The issue was caused by using a static div element instead of the interactive ProfileDropdown component.

## Root Cause
In the `mobile-header.tsx` file, the profile section was implemented as a static div:
```jsx
{user && (
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-primary text-primary-foreground text-sm font-medium">
    {user.accountNo?.charAt(0)?.toUpperCase() || 'U'}
  </div>
)}
```

This static div did not have any click handlers or dropdown functionality, making it non-interactive.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Mobile Header
Replaced the static div with the ProfileDropdown component:
```jsx
{user && <ProfileDropdown />}
```

### 2. Enhanced ProfileDropdown Component
Made several improvements to ensure proper mobile functionality:

#### Mobile Responsiveness
- Added `useIsMobile()` hook to detect mobile devices
- Adjusted dropdown menu positioning with `sideOffset` for better mobile display
- Modified width and margin for mobile screens (`w-64 mx-2`)

#### Touch Optimization
- Removed keyboard shortcuts on mobile to reduce clutter
- Maintained appropriate sizing for touch targets
- Ensured proper alignment and spacing for mobile users

#### Visual Improvements
- Added conditional styling based on device type
- Improved dropdown menu positioning for mobile screens
- Maintained visual consistency with desktop version

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/components/layout/mobile-header.tsx` - Replaced static div with ProfileDropdown component
2. `frontend/src/components/profile-dropdown.tsx` - Enhanced mobile responsiveness and touch optimization

### Key Code Changes
```jsx
// Before (mobile-header.tsx)
{user && (
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-primary text-primary-foreground text-sm font-medium">
    {user.accountNo?.charAt(0)?.toUpperCase() || 'U'}
  </div>
)}

// After (mobile-header.tsx)
{user && <ProfileDropdown />}

// Enhanced ProfileDropdown with mobile support
<DropdownMenuContent 
  className={isMobile ? 'w-64 mx-2' : 'w-64'} 
  align={isMobile ? 'end' : 'end'} 
  sideOffset={isMobile ? 4 : 8}
  forceMount
>
```
